# Overview
This plugin contains classes, scripts and tools that I use to speed up game development. They all are very specific and most likely poorly written, because I am still learning.

# Installation
To install this plugin, you can use a standard approach, such as the one described [here](https://dev.to/dolbyio/installing-unreal-engine-plugins-from-github-or-source-code-4dhb).

# Scripts that may be useful for you
**CleanAndRegenerate** - deletes temporary files and folders of the current ue-project, then launches a rebuild-tool and recreates .sln-file for Visual Studio.
